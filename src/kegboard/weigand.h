/*
 * HID RFID Reader Wiegand Interface for Arduino Uno
 * Written by Daniel Smith, 2012.01.30  www.pagemac.com
 * Ported to C++ and modified for kegbot by C. Niggel June 2012
 *
 *
 * This program will decode the wiegand data from a HID RFID Reader (or, theoretically,
 * any other device that outputs weigand data).
 * The Wiegand interface has two data lines, DATA0 and DATA1.  These lines are normall held
 * high at 5V.  When a 0 is sent, DATA0 drops to 0V for a few us.  When a 1 is sent, DATA1 drops
 * to 0V for a few us.  There is usually a few ms between the pulses.
 *
 * Operation is simple - each of the data lines are connected to hardware interrupt lines.  When
 * one drops low, an interrupt routine is called and some bits are flipped.  After some time of
 * of not receiving any bits, the Arduino will decode the data.  26 bit and 35 bit formats
 * are supported, but you can easily add more.
 * Code is available for re-use, but please keep the attribution
